# Frind-LI â€“ QueenB Hackathon Project

This project was developed as part of the QueenB Hackathon, which marked the end of a year-long program where middle school girls learned how to build websites and explore the world of technology.

As a volunteer in QueenB, I had the privilege of mentoring Group 1 â€“ a team of four talented 8th-grade students: Yasmin,Eva, Avigail, and Almog. Together, they chose to create a website dedicated entirely to helping animals, aiming to make a real impact on our society.

## ðŸŽ¯ About the Project

The girls built a website focused on animal welfare, with the goal of raising awareness and encouraging action. It includes:

- **Tips Page** â€“ Practical advice on how to care for and help animals.
- **Adoption Page** â€“ A matchmaking-style interface where users can leave their details and relevant shelters can reach out.
- **Personality Quiz** â€“ A short quiz to help users discover which animal suits them best.
- **"Why We Chose This" Page** â€“ A personal explanation from the girls about their motivation and values.
- **About Us Page** â€“ Introducing each team member in their own words.
